1. How is this model is defined?
2. How are we saving/reading a file for storing/retreiving the model. 
3. updateTrianglesList(to_add, to_remove)
	* how exactly is going to work?
	* where will it update the trianglesList? Into which list? -- model_triangle_list
4. How exactly are we going to maintain this "model_triangle_list"? -- what's the point of allocating an array on heap? -- to retain the information even if we terminate the program.
5. Need to design a wrapper to use insertAtCursor()/deleteAtCursor() functions while editing a model using the cursor.
6. Write functions to initialize the vbo and vao for the model.
7. Meaning of line no. 79 & 80 ??
